# Silly Simulation  

This was a project I worked on before having any formal education in Computer Science.  
The project itself is fun to watch, but is put together horribly, from bad naming conventions to excessive repetitive code.  
Itâ€™s nice to look back at it though to see how far I have come with the help of Eastern Oregon University.  
  
The simulation is written in python making use of the pygame library.  
It consists of NPCs running around eating random foods from a trash can, sometimes they sit on benches and they might pull a weapon from the trash and do harm to one another.
